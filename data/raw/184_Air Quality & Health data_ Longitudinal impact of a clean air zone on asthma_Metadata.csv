Provenance,"Patient pathway description","Data is representative of the multi-ethnicity population within the West Midlands (42% non white). Data includes all patients admitted during this timeframe, with National data Opt Outs applied, and therefore is representative of admissions to secondary care. Data focuses on in-patient stay in hospital during the acute episode but can be supplemented on request to include previous and subsequent hospital contacts (including outpatient appointments) and ambulance, 111, 999 data."

"Data Access Request","Access service description","Trusted Research Environments (TRE) are built using Microsoft Azure services and hosted in the UK to provide research teams a safe, secure and agile environment which allows users to quickly analyse, interpret and form an enriched view of primary care information through a range of integrated datasets.

Health data collated from multiple sources is ingested into a secure data lake which will then allow subsets of data to be made available to research teams on approval of a data request. Once approved a customer specific TRE is made available with a standard set of leading analytical tools from Microsoft including Azure Databricks, Azure Machine Learning, Azure SQL and Azure Synapse (for large-scale data warehouses). Specific tools can be provided at an additional cost over the standard platform data access charge and the PIONEER team will work with you to determine your exact needs.

Access to the TRE is managed using the latest virtual desktop technology to provide a safe and secure end-user experience.  By utilising leading edge design PIONEER are able to create TREs rapidly to enable us to service any customer requirement."
